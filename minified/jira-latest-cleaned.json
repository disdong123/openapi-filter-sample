Authorization is implemented using either \nscopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or user impersonation. See \n[Security for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) \nfor details.\n\nThe URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:\n\n`https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`\n\nFor example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`\n\n### Other integrations\n\nFor integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) for security \n(3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_).

The calling user must have the required permissions for an operation to \nuse it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required permissions for the operation and the app must \nhave scopes that permit the operation.\n\nA permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. \nSee [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) for details. The most common permissions are:\n\n- **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have this \npermission. See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.\n- **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global permission. There is a default group for this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n- **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users in the default product access group (for example, \n_jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and \n[Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n\n### Anonymous access\n\nSome operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous access is only available if \nthe Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by the operation is granted to \nthe _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) \nfor details.\n\nIf an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not available, the operation will return \nan error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that can be given public access \nprovide for anonymous access.\n","title":"Permissions"},{"anchor":"expansion","body":"### Expansion\n\nThe Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified \nin the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.\n\nTo expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. \nIf you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a \ncomma-separated list. \n\nFor example, the following request expands the `names` and `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:\n\n`GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`\n\nTo discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property in the object. \nIn the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as expandable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expand\": \"widgets\", \n  \"self\": \"https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1\", \n  \"widgets\": {\n    \"widgets\": [],\n    \"size\": 5\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large \ncollection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in \na JSON object with paging metadata. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"startAt\" : 0,\n    \"maxResults\" : 10,\n    \"total\": 200,\n    \"isLast\": false,\n    \"values\": [\n        { /* result 0 */ },\n        { /* result 1 */ },\n        { /* result 2 */ }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.\n*   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return. Each operation can have a different limit for\n    the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items \n    that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.\n*    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This number **_may change_** as the client \nrequests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note \nthat this property is not returned for all operations.\n*   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note that this property is not returned for all operations.\n\n### Ordering\n\nSome operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field. Check the documentation for the operation to \nconfirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order \nby default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:\n\n*   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.\n\n\n","title":"Expansion, pagination, and ordering"},{"anchor":"timestamps","body":"By default, top-level timestamps (e.g. updated and created) are returned in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format, in the system default user time zone.\n\nTo return date time data in the logged in user's timezone, please refer to `renderedFields` property under the `expand` query parameter in relevant APIs.\n","title":"Timestamps"},{"anchor":"special-request-headers","body":"The following request and response headers define important metadata for the Jira Cloud REST API resources.\n\n-   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`\nheader in requests.

Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. \n\n The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated \"This operation can be accessed anonymously.\"","title":"Anonymous operations"},{"anchor":"async-operations","body":"Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or computationally expensive tasks.

The content of the field is specific to the \noperation that created the task.
